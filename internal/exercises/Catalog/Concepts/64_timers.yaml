  hints:
    - Use a map[string]*time.Timer to track active timers by key.
    - Use a mutex to safely access the timers map concurrently.
    - Start a timer with time.AfterFunc(d, fn) to run a callback after duration d.
    - If Start is called again for an existing key, stop and replace the old timer.
    - Stop should remove the timer from the map and prevent the callback from firing.
    - Reset can call timer.Reset(d) to reschedule the same callback.
    - Remember to remove timers from the map after they fire to avoid memory leaks.
    - Write tests to verify Start, Stop, and Reset behavior, including concurrency scenarios.
