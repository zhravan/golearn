  title: Worker Pools
  test_regex: ".*"
  hints:
    - Create separate channels for jobs (send work) and results (receive processed data).
    - Launch multiple worker goroutines that read from jobs channel and write to results channel.
    - Use channel directions (<-chan for receive-only, chan<- for send-only) in worker function signature.
    - Close the jobs channel after sending all work to signal workers to finish.
    - Use strings.TrimSpace() to clean message strings by removing leading/trailing whitespace.
    - Collect exactly len(logs) results to ensure all work is processed.
