  hints:
    - "Use sync.WaitGroup to wait for all launched goroutines."
    - "Call wg.Add(1) before starting a goroutine and wg.Done() when it finishes."
    - "Close result channels after wg.Wait() so collectors can range over them."
    - "Capture loop variables correctly inside goroutines (e.g., `n := n`)."
    - "Return results as a slice — order does not need to match input order"
