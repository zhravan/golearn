  title: Rate Limiting
  test_regex: ".*"
  hints:
    - Implement a RateLimiter struct that tracks request timestamps per key using a map[string][]time.Time.
    - Use a mutex to safely handle concurrent access to the map.
    - In the Allow method, remove timestamps older than the interval and check if the number of recent requests exceeds the limit.
    - Reset should clear the request history for a key; if the key does not exist, do nothing.
    - Consider edge cases: multiple keys, concurrent access, and requests exactly at the interval boundary.
    - In tests, use time.Sleep with a small buffer above the interval to avoid flakiness.
    - Initialize the timestamps map in NewRateLimiter to prevent nil pointer errors.
