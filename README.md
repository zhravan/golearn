### Why this exists

This project is my attempt to learn Go by building as I learn, making the journey more engaging while exploring the language in practice. I'm sharing the exercises and tooling so others can learn alongside me.

### Install (Go 1.22+)

```bash
go install github.com/shravan20/golearn/cmd/golearn@latest
```

### Use

```bash
# In any folder, set up exercises here
golearn init

# Or clone a remote exercises repo
# golearn init <repo-url> <dir>
golearn init https://github.com/your-org/your-exercises my-exercises
cd my-exercises

# Learn
golearn list
golearn verify 01_hello
golearn progress    # Rich TUI with ASCII progress bar and checklist

# Auto-verify on change (watch mode)
golearn watch       # Watches ./exercises and re-runs tests per edited exercise
```

Need commands?

```bash
golearn help
```

## Makefile shortcuts

```bash
# Show help
make

# Run commands
make list
make verify NAME=01_hello
make progress
make watch
```

### Tips

- The progress bar adapts to terminal width via the `COLUMNS` env var.
- Press Ctrl+C to stop watch mode.
