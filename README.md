### Why this exists

This project is my attempt to learn Go by building as I learn, making the journey more engaging while exploring the language in practice. I'm sharing the exercises and tooling so others can learn alongside me.

### At a glance

- Simple CLI to list and verify exercises
- Helpful hints and solution links when you're stuck
- Watch mode to auto-run tests on changes
- Progress dashboard with a visual bar and checklists
- Publish your progress to GitHub and appear on the README leaderboard

### Install (Go 1.22+)

```bash
go install github.com/zhravan/golearn/cmd/golearn@latest
```

### Use

```bash
# In any folder, set up exercises here
golearn init

# Or clone a remote exercises repo
# golearn init <repo-url> <dir>
golearn init https://github.com/your-org/your-exercises my-exercises
cd my-exercises

# Learn
golearn list
golearn verify 01_hello
golearn hint 01_hello
golearn solution 01_hello   # Suggests hints; else prints GitHub link
golearn verify 01_hello --solution  # Run tests against the embedded solution
golearn progress    # Rich TUI with ASCII progress bar and checklist

# Auto-verify on change (watch mode)
golearn watch       # Watches ./exercises and re-runs tests per edited exercise

# Publish your progress (appears on README leaderboard)
